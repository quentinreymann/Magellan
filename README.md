# Magellan

What is the purpose of this work?

The main purpose is to train my skill in front, especially in using Primefaces and JSF. It is a simulation of a travel agency website (a french one).


What do you need to use this program:

You need to have a fonctionnal eclipse (vers Neon.2 Release (4.6.2) in my case), a working navigator : chrome, firefox or IE.

How to use it:

Copy the files and put them into your workspace, then import them. Put the project on a server (tomcat for us) then start it. When the server is started and the project was add on it, launch in your navigator the following url: http://localhost:8080/Magellan/ and be free to navigate on our new website.
